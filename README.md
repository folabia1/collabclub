## About This Project

Discover new artists with **Collab Club**. Collab Club is designed to help show you more of the music you'll love. You'll be presented with two artists and your aim is to find a link between them through songs with **collaborations** (a.k.a. features). For example, to find a link between [Drake](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4?si=1on3qchTQtWCRtgxP6-pQg) and [Justin Timberlake](https://open.spotify.com/artist/31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7?si=3TtH49-AQheh-lFIiwRtwg), the following chain be used:

- **Drake** to **Kanye West** with [Glow - (Drake, Kanye West)](https://open.spotify.com/track/28irpKCCK9nn9DZSik2zEx?si=cfeda2c48a0e4979)
- **Kanye West** to **Pop Smoke** with [Tell the Vision - (Pop Smoke, Kanye West, Pusha T)](https://open.spotify.com/track/2UwALqx6yOsXTFt7zRxnts?si=bb2e2df909124b75)
- **Pop Smoke** to **50 Cent** with [The Woo - (Pop Smoke, 50 Cent, Roddy Ricch)](https://open.spotify.com/track/1H7KnK26kc1YyellpbINEn?si=dda5183dad0342ce)
- **50 Cent** to **Justin Timberlake** with [Ayo Technology - (50 Cent, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland)](https://open.spotify.com/track/6kfQDanT6Buh4Wu73ghbav?si=a92dbbaeeac94825)

Eventually you may come across two artists that you can't link together. Here, the app will show you a possible path between them, surfacing new music related to artists in the genre of your choosing. 

Enjoy the app and the new music ðŸŽµ. Feel free to leave feature suggestions in the [Issues](https://github.com/folabia1/collabclub/issues) section of this repository.
